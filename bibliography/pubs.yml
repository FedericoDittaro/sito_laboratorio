- abstract: The principal nature-based solution for offsetting relative
    sea-level rise in the Ganges- Brahmaputra delta is the unabated
    delivery, dispersal, and deposition of the rivers'
    $\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 billion tonne annual sediment load. Recent
    hydrological transport modeling suggests that strengthening monsoon
    precipitation in the 21st century could increase this sediment
    delivery 34--60%; yet other studies demonstrate that sediment could
    decline 15--80% if planned dams and river diversions are fully
    implemented. We validate these modeled ranges by developing a
    comprehensive field-based sediment budget that quantifies the supply
    of Ganges-Brahmaputra river sediment under varying Holocene climate
    conditions. Our data reveal natural responses in sediment supply
    comparable to previously modeled results and suggest that increased
    sediment delivery may be capable of offsetting accelerated sea-level
    rise. This prospect for a naturally sustained Ganges-Brahmaputra
    delta presents possibilities beyond the dystopian future often posed
    for this system, but the implementation of currently proposed dams
    and diversions would preclude such opportunities.

- abstract: Sustainable use of water resources continues to be a
    challenge across the globe. This is in part due to the complex set
    of physical and social behaviors that interact to influence water
    management from local to global scales. Analyses of water resources
    have been conducted using a variety of techniques, including
    qualitative evaluations of media narratives. This study aims to
    augment these methods by leveraging computational and quantitative
    techniques from the social sciences focused on text analyses.
    Specifically, we use natural language processing methods to
    investigate a large corpus (approx. 1.8M) of newspaper articles
    spanning approximately 35 years (1982--2017) for insights into
    human-nature interactions with water. Focusing on local and regional
    United States publications, our analysis demonstrates important
    dynamics in water-related dialogue about drinking water and
    pollution to other critical infrastructures, such as energy, across
    different parts of the country. Our assessment, which looks at water
    as a system, also highlights key actors and sentiments surrounding
    water. Extending these analytical methods could help us further
    improve our understanding of the complex roles of water in current
    society that should be considered in emerging activities to mitigate
    and respond to resource conflicts and climate change.

- abstract: As researchers collect large amounts of data in the social
    sciences through household surveys, challenges may arise in how best
    to analyze such datasets, especially where motivating theories are
    unclear or conflicting. New analytical methods may be necessary to
    extract information from these datasets. Machine learning techniques
    are promising methods for identifying patterns in large datasets,
    but have not yet been widely used to identify important variables in
    social surveys with many questions. To demonstrate the potential of
    machine learning to analyze large social datasets, we apply machine
    learning techniques to the study of migration in Bangladesh. The
    complexity of migration decisions makes them suitable for analysis
    with machine learning techniques, which enable pattern
    identification in large datasets with many covariates. In this
    paper, we apply random forest methods to analyzing a large survey
    which captures approximately 2000 variables from approximately 1700
    households in southwestern Bangladesh. Our analysis ranked the
    covariates in the dataset in terms of their predictive power for
    migration decisions. The results identified the most important
    covariates, but there exists a tradeoff between predictive ability
    and interpretability. To address this tradeoff, random forests and
    other machine learning algorithms may be especially useful in
    combination with more traditional regression methods. To develop
    insights into how the important variables identified by the random
    forest algorithm impact migration, we performed a survival analysis
    of household time to first migration. With this combined analysis,
    we found that variables related to wealth and household composition
    are important predictors of migration. Such multi-methods approaches
    may help to shed light on factors contributing to migration and
    non-migration.

- abstract: The decision to migrate is complex and is often influenced
    by a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental
    pressures. Household survey instruments can capture detailed
    information about migration histories and their contexts, but it can
    be challenging to identify important predictors from large numbers
    of covariates with standard statistical methods, such as regression
    analyses. Machine learning techniques are well suited to pattern
    identification and can identify important covariates from large
    datasets. We report on the application of machine learning
    approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of more than
    2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random forest
    classification and regression models to identify significant
    covariates with the greatest predictive power for household
    migration decisions. The results show that random forest models are
    able to identify nuances in predictors of different types of
    migration and migration in different communities. Random forests
    also outperform logistic regression and support vector machines in
    predicting migration in all cases analyzed. Therefore, random forest
    models and other machine learning methods can be useful for
    improving the predictive accuracy of migration models and
    identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should
    continue to explore the potential of machine learning techniques
    applied to questions of environmental migration.

- abstract: Environmental change interacts with population migration in
    complex ways that depend on interactions between impacts on
    individual households and on communities. These coupled
    individual-collective dynamics make agent-based simulations useful
    for studying environmental migration. We present an original
    agent-based model that simulates environment-migration dynamics in
    terms of the impacts of natural hazards on labor markets in rural
    communities, with households deciding whether to migrate based on
    maximizing their expected income. We use a pattern-oriented approach
    that seeks to reproduce observed patterns of environmentally-driven
    migration in Bangladesh. The model is parameterized with empirical
    data and unknown parameters are calibrated to reproduce the observed
    patterns. This model can reproduce these patterns, but only for a
    narrow range of parameters. Future work will compare
    income-maximizing decisions to psychologically complex decision
    heuristics that include non-economic considerations.
