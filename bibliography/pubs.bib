  abstract     = {The principal nature-based solution for offsetting relative sea-level rise in the Ganges-
Brahmaputra delta is the unabated delivery, dispersal, and deposition of the rivers'
$\sim$1 billion
tonne annual sediment load. Recent hydrological transport modeling suggests that
strengthening monsoon precipitation in the 21st century could increase this sediment delivery
34--60\%; yet other studies demonstrate that sediment could decline 15--80\% if planned dams
and river diversions are fully implemented. We validate these modeled ranges by developing a
comprehensive field-based sediment budget that quantifies the supply of Ganges-Brahmaputra
river sediment under varying Holocene climate conditions. Our data reveal natural responses in
sediment supply comparable to previously modeled results and suggest that increased
sediment delivery may be capable of offsetting accelerated sea-level rise. This prospect for a
naturally sustained Ganges-Brahmaputra delta presents possibilities beyond the dystopian
future often posed for this system, but the implementation of currently proposed dams and
diversions would preclude such opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable use of water resources continues to be a challenge across the globe. This is in part due to the complex set of physical and social behaviors that interact to influence water management from local to global scales. Analyses of water resources have been conducted using a variety of techniques, including qualitative evaluations of media narratives. This study aims to augment these methods by leveraging computational and quantitative techniques from the social sciences focused on text analyses. Specifically, we use natural language processing methods to investigate a large corpus (approx. 1.8M) of newspaper articles spanning approximately 35 years (1982--2017) for insights into human-nature interactions with water. Focusing on local and regional United States publications, our analysis demonstrates important dynamics in water-related dialogue about drinking water and pollution to other critical infrastructures, such as energy, across different parts of the country. Our assessment, which looks at water as a system, also highlights key actors and sentiments surrounding water. Extending these analytical methods could help us further improve our understanding of the complex roles of water in current society that should be considered in emerging activities to mitigate and respond to resource conflicts and climate change.}

  abstract     = {As researchers collect large amounts of data in the social sciences through household surveys,
              challenges may arise in how best to analyze such datasets, especially where motivating theories
              are unclear or conflicting. New analytical methods may be necessary to extract information from
              these datasets. Machine learning techniques are promising methods for identifying patterns in
              large datasets, but have not yet been widely used to identify important variables in social surveys
              with many questions. To demonstrate the potential of machine learning to analyze large social datasets,
              we apply machine learning techniques to the study of migration in Bangladesh. The complexity of
              migration decisions makes them suitable for analysis with machine learning techniques, which enable
              pattern identification in large datasets with many covariates. In this paper, we apply random forest
              methods to analyzing a large survey which captures approximately 2000 variables from approximately
              1700 households in southwestern Bangladesh. Our analysis ranked the covariates in the dataset in terms
              of their predictive power for migration decisions. The results identified the most important covariates,
              but there exists a tradeoff between predictive ability and interpretability. To address this tradeoff,
              random forests and other machine learning algorithms may be especially useful in combination with more
              traditional regression methods. To develop insights into how the important variables identified by the
              random forest algorithm impact migration, we performed a survival analysis of household time to first
              migration. With this combined analysis, we found that variables related to wealth and household composition
              are important predictors of migration. Such multi-methods approaches may help to shed light on factors
              contributing to migration and non-migration.},

  abstract     = {The decision to migrate is complex and is often influenced by
    a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental pressures.
    Household survey instruments can capture detailed information about
    migration histories and their contexts, but it can be challenging to
    identify important predictors from large numbers of covariates with
    standard statistical methods, such as regression analyses. Machine learning
    techniques are well suited to pattern identification and can identify
    important covariates from large datasets. We report on the application of
    machine learning approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of
    more than 2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random
    forest classification and regression models to identify significant
    covariates with the greatest predictive power for household migration
    decisions. The results show that random forest models are able to identify
    nuances in predictors of different types of migration and migration in
    different communities. Random forests also outperform logistic regression
    and support vector machines in predicting migration in all cases analyzed.
    Therefore, random forest models and other machine learning methods can be
    useful for improving the predictive accuracy of migration models and
    identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should
    continue to explore the potential of machine learning techniques applied to
    questions of environmental migration.},

These coupled individual-collective dynamics make agent-based simulations useful for studying environmental migration. We present an original agent-based model that simulates environment-migration dynamics in terms of the impacts of natural hazards on labor markets in rural communities, with households deciding whether to migrate based on maximizing their expected income. We use a pattern-oriented approach that seeks to reproduce observed patterns of environmentally-driven migration in Bangladesh. The model is parameterized with empirical data and unknown parameters are calibrated to reproduce the observed patterns. This model can reproduce these patterns, but only for a narrow range of parameters. Future work will compare income-maximizing decisions to psychologically complex decision heuristics that include non-economic considerations.},
